# Openshock Prefabs
Here you'll find some Prefabs I created in Unity for either [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/) or [ChilloutVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/661130/ChilloutVR/) to utilize the [Openshock](https://github.com/OpenShock) project in either of those games.
