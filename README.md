# Openshock Prefabs
Here you'll find some prefabs I created in Unity for [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/) and [ChilloutVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/661130/ChilloutVR/) to utilize the [Openshock](https://github.com/OpenShock) project in either of those games.

All of the [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/) prefabs use [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/).

To use [ShockOSC](https://github.com/OpenShock/ShockOsc) in ChilloutVR you'll need a OSC mod. One of the most popular ones are [OSC by kafeijao](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods?tab=readme-ov-file).
